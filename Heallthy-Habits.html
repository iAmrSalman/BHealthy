			Long-term research studies show that people who get significantly less than seven hours a night die younger. In addition, some research shows that people who sleep more than nine hours also have problems.

			For instance, people who live close (within about a half-mile) to a good amount of green space are healthier than those who live farther away from it, 
			according to a <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/63/12/967.full.pdf+html"><u>2009 study</u></a> published in the <i>Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.</i> 
			People who lived close to a high percentage of green space had fewer anxiety disorders, 
			and fewer infectious diseases of the digestive system, among other perks.

			Exercise and physical activity are not only good for you, they&#39;re also a fun way to spend time-a chance to unwind, to be outdoors, 
			to get social or to simply do something that makes you happy.<br>
			Find a physical activity you enjoy and do it every day. Better yet, find two or more types of activity to do to prevent boredom and overuse injuries. 
			Pace yourself according to your age and fitness level. Start with a warm up and end with cool down. 
			Increase time and intensity gradually. Consider exercising with a committed friend or involve your family. 
			A good general goal is to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily. <br>
			If you want to lose weight or increase your fitness level, you may need more exercise or at a higher intensity. 
			Bottom line, all movement counts, not just exercise.</p>

			Stress is not just a psychological concept, but also a physiological one. Stress isn&#39;t all bad; it helps motivate you in threatening situations. 
			That being said, the fast pace of modern society has led to persistent or chronic stress, which has some serious physical side effects.<br>
			Stress releases the hormone cortisol (as well as other hormones), prompting the fight-or-flight response. 
			Elevated cortisol has been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, reduced immune function, and cognitive impairment.
			Another study pointed out that cortisol increases risk of osteoporosis, intestinal problems such as ulcers, 
			and could potentially have negative effects on almost every regulatory system in the body. <br>
			If all of this is making you want to rip your hair out, keep in mind that stress also slows the speed of wound healing.

			<br>
			<td>
			<p>
			Being kind to others appears to be genetically hardwired into us humans. The natural inclination that people have is to be altruistic. 
			Given that, doesn&#39;t it seem like a perfectly rational thing to assume that other people have positive intentions? <br>
			I think it&#39;s obvious that trusting others and assuming that they are friendly will lead to an improved social life. 
			There is also evidence that being more trusting is intrinsically valuable and may cause an increase in subjective well-being.</p>
			<p>
			Let&#39;s forget about scientific arguments for a moment. Finding the positive qualities in other people is an important part of your personal development.
			As you get better at finding the positive aspects of other people, you become more proficient at finding the positive aspects of yourself.

			<h2>14. Learn to forgive others and let go of grudges.</h2>

			<br>
			<br>
			<td>
			<p>
			One of the hardest things you can do is learn to forgive others who have wronged you in some way. Think for a moment about what unforgiveness actually is. 
			The refusal to forgive someone else is a self-imposed stressor. 
			By not forgiving someone, you are essentially punishing yourself for what the other person did to you! 
			When put this way, doesn&#39;t holding a grudge seem like a stupid idea?
			</p>
			<p>
			Moreover, if refusing to forgive someone is a stressor, you might expect it to have some negative health effects as well. 
			Both forgiveness (the specific act) and forgivingness (a disposition or personality trait) have been found to improve the body&#39;s physiological response to stress 
			through lower blood pressure, heart rate, and quicker recovery from acute stressors. 
			A word of caution though: people who will only conditionally forgive others, such as in exchange for compensation or an apology, have increased mortality risk. 
			You must be willing to let go of your grudge regardless of the other person&#39;s response.
			</p>
			<p>
			Cultivating a forgiving attitude is no easy task. A helpful first step is to find the positive intention behind the other person&#39;s actions 
			(see <a href="#13">#13</a>).
