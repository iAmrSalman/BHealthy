 		<p> Our body and our mind are connected. Being active makes us happier as well as being good for our physical health. It instantly improves our mood and can even lift us out of a depression. We don't all need to run marathons - there are simple things we can all do to be more active each day. 
 	<h2>1. Take time for exercise</h2>
		<p>I have to admit that I’m not a huge fan of this one because physical activity actually compounds the problems I experience with my body. But occasionally, when my joints aren’t screaming, I make sure that I keep my limbs limber by going for a gentle walk.
		This is the point of exercising your body–only do what your body can manage if you’re struggling, as there’s no point in making things harder. Even a little activity can have a huge impact.</p>

  <h2> 2. Make sleep a priority</h2>
		<p> If you’re tired, even if you feel that you need to get more done, give yourself permission to sleep. I ignored this simple notion for nearly a year when I first started feeling unwell. Now that I embrace it, my body thanks me for it. 
		Admittedly, my condition keeps rest and sleep from being as refreshing as they might be for other people, but it still makes a difference. It stops me from doing further damage.</p>
  <h2>3. Eat well and savor it</h2>
      <p>We’re encouraged to be increasingly mindful of what we eat nowadays, and for good reason considering the state of the food we consume. I’d like to encourage you, however, to turn your attention inward for a moment and think about eating as more than a bland necessity or ethical conundrum. Food is fuel, and we need it to function optimally Eating well means feeding your body what it needs, in the most natural way you can manage and afford. Changing how you eat doesn’t need to be an all-or-nothing thing. Maybe you could add just an extra bit of fruit a day or swap a cup of coffee for a glass of water instead.</p>
  <h2>4. Listen to pain</h2>
      <p>When something hurts, something somewhere has gone wrong, and your body is trying to tell you that. We often pay no attention to pain unless it becomes unbearable: that tooth ache isn’t so bad, it can wait for a while; the sharp tugging in my shoulder is a result of repetitive strain but it usually goes by the time I’m home, so no need to worry.These things, no matter how small, shouldn’t be brushed aside because they represent damage to our bodies. Ignore them and they could come back to haunt you later.</p>
  <h2>5. Relax</h2>
     <p>It's time to get comfy! Watch your favorite movie or read a good book.</p>
